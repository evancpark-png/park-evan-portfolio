## Pen Turning

We were given a pen kit, We were tasked with using a lathe to turn a chosen piece of wood so that we could assemble the pen utilizing that wood.

(kit and wood chosen?)

We used a bandsaw to cut the piece of wood that we chose so that they would be perfect size for our pen, we made sure that the length of the wood was the same length as the brass piece that is the base for the pen.

We then utilized the Jet Mini Lathe to drill a hole into the wood. This machine spun the wood incredibly fast while you manually insert a drill into the wood to drill a hole. the speed is the how fast the wood turns and the feed is how much of the drill we put into the wood.

After this we glued our sanded pieces into the wood and applied a glue accelerant.

After gluing our pieces into the wood, we put the wood pieces on the wood turner. The woodturner allowed us to shape the wood down to a size that would be manageable on our pen. When putting the wood pieces on, we put bearings on each end of the wood and a metal piece to keep the wood in place. We then used a square shaped pen turning tool to get the majority of the wood down and a circle shaped pen turning tool to create better details in the wood like bevels. Once we had shaped the wood to our liking, we then sanded the wood by starting at a low grit and increasing the grit over time.

Unfortunately, the wood that I chose was weaker than I thought and it broke while I was trying to turn it. This meant I had to get a new brass piece and a stronger piece of wood and repeat the process again.

Once this was done though, the turning went smoothly.

After we made our wood smooth, we applied a thin layer of polish to it while using the turning of the wood to apply the polish. This made the wood look very shiny and finished

Now all we have to do is assemble the pen, we did this by using a machine which pressed the pieces into each other tightly which allowed them to fit into one another.

This is my assembled pen.
